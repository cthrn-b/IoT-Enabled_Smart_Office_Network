# Comprehensive Network Design & Implementation for IoT-Enabled Smart Office Network

## Overview
This project focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating a **comprehensive network solution** that integrates **advanced routing, scalability, performance optimization, and security**. It also explores **emerging technologies** such as **IoT, SDN, NFV, and edge computing** for a modern network architecture.

## Objectives
- Design a **secure and scalable IPv6-enabled network**.
- Implement **advanced routing protocols** (OSPFv3, BGP) for efficient data traffic.
- Integrate **wireless connectivity** using **Wi-Fi 6 or mesh networking**.
- Ensure **high availability** with **redundancy protocols** (HSRP/VRRP) and load balancing.
- Enhance **security** through **firewalls, IPSec VPNs, and IDS/IPS solutions**.
- Test and evaluate **performance, security, and troubleshooting methods**.

## Network Design Components
### **1. IPv6-Based Secure Network**
- Addressing scheme for different network segments.
- Implementation of **dynamic routing protocols** (OSPFv3, BGP).

### **2. Wireless & IoT Integration**
- Use of **Wi-Fi 6 and VLANs** for device segmentation.
- Smart office network with **IoT devices** integrated into separate VLANs.

### **3. High Availability & Redundancy**
- **Failover protocols** such as **HSRP or VRRP**.
- Load balancing to **distribute network traffic**.

### **4. Network Security Measures**
- **IPSec VPNs** for remote access security.
- **Firewalls and intrusion detection (IDS/IPS)** to monitor threats.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to manage traffic.

## Implementation Steps
### **Step 1: Network Simulation Setup**
- Use **Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or EVE-NG** for network design.
- Configure **IPv6 addressing, VLANs, and wireless access points**.

### **Step 2: Routing & Protocol Configuration**
- Implement **OSPFv3 for internal routing**.
- Configure **BGP for external connectivity**.

### **Step 3: Security & Redundancy Setup**
- Apply **firewall rules and VPNs** for data protection.
- Implement **HSRP/VRRP for failover and load balancing**.

### **Step 4: Testing & Troubleshooting**
- **Connectivity tests** using **ping and traceroute**.
- **Performance tests** (latency, throughput, and packet loss).
- **Security validation** to check firewall rules and VPN access.
